# Setup

The instructions for downloading the DataJoint library are available here:

http://docs.datajoint.io/setup/Install-and-connect.html

Be sure to set your PYTHONPATH variable accordingly so that the
code here is included in sys.path. For example, 'cd' into this
directory to start the interpreter, or can add it from within python
as follows:

    >>> import sys
    >>> import os
    >>> sys.path.insert(0, '/the/path/to/the/code')  # or. e.g 'C:\tutorial'

From here, you can install jupyter notebook and start the jupyter notebook 
viewer to interact with the example notebook from the command line as follows::

    $ pip install jupyter
    $ jupyter notebook
