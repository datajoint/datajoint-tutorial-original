Setting up for DataJoint
------------------------
**Author**: Edgar Y. Walker

**Updated**: 2017-06-05

In this tutorial, we will cover how to set up a DataJoint Python or MATLAB development environment
suitable for following the other tutorials and to explore DataJoint in general. A functional 
DataJoint development setup consists of two parts - a database server for hosting data pipelines 
and a Python or MATLAB environment with DataJoint library installed. Naturally, our objectives for 
this tutorial are as follows:

- Explore options on :doc:`how to get connected to a database server <get-database>`
- Installing DataJoint library for :doc:`Python <datajoint-python>` or :doc:`MATLAB <datajoint-matlab>`

System requirements
===================
.. Note:: 
    To complete this tutorial as well as others, you would need a computer with an Internet connection
    running MacOS, Windows or Linux operating system with either Python 3 or MATLAB already installed,
    depending on your language preference. DataJoint for Python requires Python 3.4 or above with `pip`
    already configured (for help on setting up a Python development environment, you can find great 
    resources online including `this <http://python-guide-pt-br.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_). DataJoint for 
    MATLAB requires MATLAB verion 2015b or later.
